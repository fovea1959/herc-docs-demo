# Continuous Documentation: Hosting Read the Docs on GitHub Pages

This repo is a fork-ready base for your project's documentation. It lets you host a sphinx-generated site (with the Read the Docs theme) on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

# How to use this repo

1. Fork this repo
1. On your forked repo, go to the "Actions" tab and click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" to enable GitHub workflows
1. On your forked repo, go to the "Settings" tab. Under "GitHub Pages" choose 'gh-pages branch' under "Source"
1. Make a small change to [docs/index.rst](/docs/index.rst)
1. `git commit` and `git push` something to trigger your site to be built

Every time you push to github.com on master, github will automatically spin up a container in their cloud to update your documentation.

After you begin to edit the contents of the site, you'll probably also want to customize  the following files:

1. [docs/conf.py](/docs/conf.py)
1. The python files in [src/](/src/)
1. Other `.rst` files in [docs/](/docs) as needed

For more details on how this works, see [Continuous Documentation: Hosting Read the Docs on GitHub Pages](https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/2020/07/18/sphinx-rtd-github-pages-1/)

# Local Iteration

As shown above, you can simply push your changes to GitHub to update your sphinx documentation website.

However, you can also build the site locally on your computer for faster iteration.

## Linux

To build the site on Debian Linux, first download some dependencies

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install git firefox-esr python3-git python3-sphinx python3-sphinx-rtd-theme
```

Change into the `docs` directory of this repo and build the sphinx site with `make`

```
cd rtd-github-pages/docs/
make clean
make html
```

You can view the site (built into the `_build/html/` directory) using firefox

```
firefox-esr _build/html/index.html
```
